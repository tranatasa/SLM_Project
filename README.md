# SLM_Project

This project illustrates how to easily manage a maintenance mode on Spring boot based APIs

It is able to:

* deliver the message to a client
* set it to a specific message
* reset the message

## Requirements
Use GitHub for the project and follow the correct DevOps procedure. Use a Kanban board to manage your User Stories and use a git branching model (preferable gitflow) to manage your code. Track your development process by updating your Kanban board and write at least one unit tests for every requirement. A Continuous Integration pipeline that produces the finished software artifact should be implemented as well.
